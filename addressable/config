[smoothing]

# Noise reduction, float 0 - 1. default 0.77
# the raw visualization is very noisy, this factor adjusts the integral and gravity filters to keep the signal smooth
# 1 will be very slow and smooth, 0 will be fast but noisy.

[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
